NOTE
====
This is an evolving code base.  I'm constantly tinkering with it.  That said, now that I'm releasing this to the world, I'm being somewhat more responsible about locking down stable release points.  In between releases, however, I'll be messing with things. **It's very possible I could break something while doing this, so check back for status updates if you download the code in between releases**.  I've finally become a little more modern and started adding automated testing, so as time goes by hopefully the "in between" releases will be somewhat more reliable.  Check back often for exciting new features and bug fixes!

Introduction
============
Why do I want to know about time lagged correlations?
-----------------------------------------------------
This comes out of work by our group (The Opto-Magnetic group at McLean Hospital - http://www.nirs-fmri.net) looking at the correlations between neuroimaging data (fMRI) and NIRS data recorded simultaneously, either in the brain or the periphery.  We found that a large fraction of the "noise" we found at low frequency in fMRI data was due to real, random[*] fluctuations of blood oxygenation and volume (both of which affect the intensity of BOLD fMRI images) in the blood passing through the brain. More interestingly, because these characteristics of blood move with the blood itself, this gives you a way to determine blood arrival time at any location in the brain. This is interesting in and of itself, but also, this gives you a method for optimally modelling (and removing) in band physiological noise from fMRI data (see references below).
 
After working with this for several years we've also found that you don't need to used simultaneous NIRS to find this blood borne signal - you can get it from blood rich BOLD voxels for example in the superior sagittal sinus, or bootstrap it out of the global mean signal in the BOLD data. You can also track exogenously applied waveforms, such as hypercarbic and/or hyperoxic gas challenges to really boost your signal to noise.  So there are lots of times when you might want to do this type of correlation analysis.  This package provides the tools to make that easier.
      
As an aside, some of these tools are just generally useful for looking at correlations between timecourses from other sources – for example doing PPI, or even some seed based analyses.
      
Why are you releasing your code?
--------------------------------
For a number of reasons.
    #.    I want people to use it!  I think if it were easier for people to do time delay analysis, they’d be more likely to do it.  I don’t have enough time or people in my group to do every experiment that I think would be interesting, so I’m hoping other people will, so I can read their papers and learn interesting things.
      
    #.    It’s the right way to do science – I can say lots of things, but if nobody can replicate my results, nobody will believe it (we’ve gotten that a lot, because some of the implications of what we’ve seen in resting state data can be a little uncomfortable).  We’ve reached a stage in fMRI where getting from data to results involves a huge amount of processing, so part of confirming results involves being able to see how the data were processed. If you had to do everything from scratch, you’d never even try to confirm anybody’s results.
      
    #.    In any complicated processing scheme, it’s quite possible (or in my case, likely) to make dumb mistakes, either coding errors or conceptual errors, and I almost certainly have made some (although hopefully the worst ones have been dealt with at this point).  More users and more eyes on the code make it more likely that they will be found.  As much as I’m queasy about somebody potentially finding a mistake in my code, I’d rather that they did so, so I can fix it[‡].
      
    #.    It’s giving back to the community.  I benefit from the generosity of a lot of authors who have made the open source tools I use for work and play, so I figure I can pony up too.
      
A note on coding quality and style:
-----------------------------------
This code has been in active development since June of 2012.  This has two implications.  The first is that it has been tuned and refined quite a bit over the years, with a lot of optimizations and bug fixes - most of the core routines have been tested fairly extensively to get rid of the stupidest bugs.  I find new bugs all the time, but most of the showstoppers seem to be gone.  The second result is that the coding style is all over the place.  When I started writing this, I had just moved over from C, and it was basically a mental port of how I would write it in C, and was extremely unpythonic (I’ve been told by a somewhat reliable source that looking over some of my early python efforts “made his eyes bleed”).  Over the years, as I've gone back and added functions, I periodically get embarassed and upgrade things to a somewhat more modern coding style.  I even put in some classes - that's what the cool kids do, right?  But the pace of that effort has to be balanced with the fact that when I make major architectural changes, I tend to break things.  So be patient with me, and keep in mind that you get what you pay for, and this cost you nothing!  Function before form.

Python version compatibility: 
-----------------------------
This code has been extensively tested in python 2.7.  I dragged my feet somewhat making it python 3 compatible, since a number of the libraries I needed took a long time to get ported to python 3, and I honestly saw no advantage to doing it.  I have since decided that I’m going to have to do it eventually, so why not now?  As far as I know, the code all works fine in python 3.5 now - I’ve switched over to that on my development machine, and have not hit any version related issues in a while now, and according to PyCharm’s code inspection, there are no incompatible constructions.  However that’s no guarantee that there isn’t a problem in some option I haven’t bothered to test yet, so be vigilant, and please let me know if there is some issue with python 3 that I haven’t caught (or any bugs, really).
      
How do I cite this?

Good question!  I think the following will work, although I should probably get a DOI for this.

What’s included in this package?
================================
I’ve included a number of tools to get you going – I’ll add in a number of other utilities as I get them closer to the point that I can release them without people laughing at my code.  For the time being, I’m including the following:

rapidtide2
----------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

	The central program in this package is rapidtide2.  This is the program that quantifies the correlation strength and time delay of pervasive signals in a BOLD fMRI dataset.

	At its core, rapidtide2 is simply performing a full crosscorrelation between a "probe" timecourse and every voxel in an fMRI dataset (by “full” I mean over a range of time lags that account for any delays between the signals, rather than only at zero lag, as in a Pearson correlation).  As with many things, however, the devil is in the details, and so rapidtide2 provides a number of features which make it pretty good at this particular task.  A few highlights:

	#. There are lots of ways to do something even as simple as a cross-correlation in a nonoptimal way (not windowing, improper normalization, doing it in the time rather than frequency domain, etc.).  I'm pretty sure what rapidtide2 does by default is, if not the best way, at least a very good and very fast way.

	#. rapidtide2 has been optimized and profiled to speed it up quite a bit; it has an optional dependency on numba – if it’s installed, some of the most heavily used routines will speed up significantly due to judicious use of @jit.

	#. The sample rate of your probe regressor and the fMRI data do not have to match - rapidtide2 resamples the probe regressor to an integral multiple of the fMRI data rate automatically.

	#. The probe and data can be temporally prefiltered to the LFO, respiratory, or cardiac frequency band with a command line switch, or you can specify any low, high, or bandpass range you want.

	#. The data can be spatially smoothed at runtime (so you don't have to keep smoothed versions of big datasets around).  This is quite fast, so no reason not to do it this way.

	#. rapidtide2 can generate a probe regressor from the global mean of the data itself - no externally recorded timecourse is required.  Optionally you can input both a mask of regions that you want to be included in the mean, and the voxels that you want excluded from the mean (there are situations when you might want to do one or the other or both).
	
	#. Determining the significance threshold for filtered correlations where the optimal delay has been selected is nontrivial; using the conventional formulae for the significance of a correlation leads to wildly inflated p values.  rapidtide2 estimates the spurious correlation threshold by calculating the distribution of null correlation values obtained with a shuffling  procedure at the beginning of each run (the default is to use 10000 shuffled correlations), and uses this value to mask the correlation maps it calculates.  As of version 0.1.2 it will also handle two-tailed significance, which you need when using bipolar mode.

	#. rapidtide2 can do an iterative refinement of the probe regressor by aligning the voxel timecourses in time and regenerating the test regressor.

	#. rapidtide2 fits the peak of the correlation function, so you can make fine grained distinctions between close lag times. The resolution of the time lag discrimination is set by the length of the timecourse, not the timestep – this is a feature of correlations, not rapidtide2.

	#. Once the time delay in each voxel has been found, rapidtide2 outputs a 4D file of delayed probe regressors for using as voxel specific confound regressors or to estimate the strength of the probe regressor in each voxel.  This regression is performed by default, but these outputs let you do it yourself if you are so inclined.

	#. I've put a lot of effort into making the outputs as informative as possible - lots of useful maps, histograms, timecourses, etc.

	#. There are a lot of tuning parameters you can mess with if you feel the need.  I've tried to make intelligent defaults so things will work well out of the box, but you have the ability to set most of the interesting parameters yourself.
     
Inputs:
^^^^^^^
	At a minimum, rapidtide2 needs a Nifti file to work on (space by time), which is generally thought to be a BOLD fMRI data file.  This can be Nifti1 or Nifti2; I can currently read (probably) but not write Cifti files, so if you want to use grayordinate files you need to convert them to nifti in workbench, run rapidtide2, then convert back. As soon as nibabel finishes their Cifti support, I'll add that.

	The file needs one time dimension and at least one spatial dimension.  Internally, the array is flattened to a time by voxel array for simplicity.

	The file you input here should be the result of any preprocessing you intend to do.  The expectation is that rapidtide will be run as the last preprocessing step before resting state or task based analysis.  So any slice time correction, motion correction, spike removal, etc. should already have been done.  If you use FSL, this means that if you've run preprocessing, you would use the filtered_func_data.nii.gz file as input.  Temporal and spatial filtering are the two (partial) exceptions here.  Generally rapidtide is most useful for looking at low frequency oscillations, so when you run it, you usually use the "-L" option or some other to limit the analysis to the detection and removal of low frequency systemic physiological oscillations.  So rapidtide will generally apply it's own temporal filtering on top of whatever you do in preprocessing.  Also, you have the option of doing spatial smoothing in rapidtide to boost the SNR of the analysis; the hemodynamic signals rapidtide looks for are often very smooth, so you rather than smooth your functional data excessively, you can do it within rapidtide so that only the hemodynamic data is smoothed at that level.
     
Outputs:
^^^^^^^^
	Outputs are space or space by time Nifti files (depending on the file), and some text files containing textual information, histograms, or numbers.  Output spatial dimensions and file type match the input dimensions and file type (Nifti1 in, Nifti1 out).  Depending on the file type of map, there can be no time dimension, a time dimension that matches the input file, or something else, such as a time lag dimension for a correlation map.

		    -A, --AR                 - Set AR model order to ORDER (default is 1)

        
	These options are somewhat self-explanatory.  I will be expanding this section of the manual going forward, but I want to put something here to get this out here.
	
Examples:
^^^^^^^^^
Rapidtide can do many things - as I've found more interesting things to do with time delay processing, it's gained new functions and options to support these new applications.  As a result, it can be a little hard to know what to use for a new experiment.  To help with that, I've decided to add this section to the manual to get you started.  It's broken up by type of data/analysis you might want to do.

	Removing low frequency physiological noise from resting state data
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	This is what I thought most people would use rapidtide for - finding and removing the low frequency (LFO) signal from an existing dataset.  This presupposes you have not made a simultaneous physiological recording (well, you may have, but it assumes you aren't using it).  For this, you can use a minimal set of options, since the defaults are mostly right.

	The base command you'd use would be:

		::

			rapidtide2 inputfmrifile outputname -L --refinepasses=3 --refineoffset

	This will do a fairly simple analysis.  First, the -L option means that rapidtide2 will prefilter the data to the LFO band (0.009-0.15Hz). It will then construct a regressor from the global mean of the signal in inputfmrifile (default behavior if no regressor is specified), and then use crosscorrelation to determine the time delay in each voxel.  The --refinepasses=3 option directs rapidtide to to perform the delay analysis 3 times, each time generating a new estimate of the global noise signal by aligning all of the timecourses in the data to bring the global signal in phase prior to averaging.  The --refineoffset flag recenters the peak of the delay distribution on zero during the refinement process, which should make datasets easier to compare.  After the three passes are complete, it will then use a GLM filter to remove a lagged copy of the final mean regressor that from the data - this denoised data will be in the file "outputname_filtereddata.nii.gz".  There will also a number of maps output with the prefix "outputname_" of delay, correlation strength and so on.

	Mapping long time delays in response to a gas challenge experiment
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	Processing this sort of data requires a very different set of options from the previous case.  Instead of the distribution of delays you expect in healthy controls (a slightly skewed, somewhat normal distribution with a tail on the positive side, ranging from about -5 to 5 seconds), in this case, the maximum delay can be extremely long (100-120 seconds is not uncommon in stroke, moyamoya disesase, and atherosclerosis).  To do this, you need to radically change what options you use, not just the delay range, but a number of other options having to do with refinement and statistical measures.

	For this type of analysis, a good place to start is the following:

		::

			rapidtide2 inputfmrifile outputname -N 0 -r -10,140 -F 0.0,0.2 --lagmaxthresh=40 --ampthresh=0.2 --noglm --nofitfilt

	The first option (-N 0), shuts off the calculation of the null correlation distribution.  This is used to determine the significance threshold, but the method currently implemented in rapidtide2 is a bit simplistic - it assumes that all the time points in the data are exchangable.  This is certainly true for resting state data (see above), but it is very much NOT true for block paradigm gas challenges.  To properly analyze those, I need to consider what time points are 'equivalent', and up to now, I don't, so setting the number of iterations in the Monte Carlo analysis to zero omits this step.

	The second option (-r -10,140) is fairly obvious - this extends the detectable delay range out to 140 seconds.  Note that this is somewhat larger than the maximum delays we frequently see, but to find the correlation peak with maximum precision, you need sufficient additional delay values so that the correlation can come to a peak and then come down enough that you can properly fit it. 

	The -noglm option disables data filtering.  If you are using rapidtide to estimate and remove low frequency noise from resting state or task fMRI data, the last step is to use a glm filter to remove this circulatory signal, leaving "pure" neuronal activations, which you'll use in further analyses.  That's not relevant here - the signal you'd be removing is the one you care about. So this option skips that step to save time and disk space.

	--nofitfilt skips a step after peak estimation.  Estimating the delay and correlation amplitude in each voxel is a two step process. First you make a quick estimate (where is the maximum point of the correlation function, and what is its amplitude?), then you refine it by fitting a Gaussian function to the peak to improve the estimate.  If this step fails, which it can if the peak is too close to the end of the lag range, or strangely shaped, the default behavior is to mark the point as bad and zero out the parameters for the voxel.  The nofitfilt option means that if the fit fails, output the initial estimates rather than all zeros.   This means that you get some information, even if it's not fully refined.  In my experience it does tend to make the maps for the gas challenge experiments a lot cleaner to use this option since the correlation function is pretty well behaved.


rapidtide2std
-------------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

	This is a utility for registering rapidtide output maps
	to standard coordinates.  It's usually much faster to run rapidtide
	in native space then transform afterwards to MNI152 space.  NB: this 
	will only work if you have a working FSL installation.

Inputs:
^^^^^^^

Outputs:
^^^^^^^^
	New versions of the rapidtide output maps, registered to either MNI152 space or to the hires anatomic images for the subject.  All maps are named with the specified root name with '_std' appended.

Usage:
^^^^^^

	::

		usage: rapidtide2std INPUTFILEROOT OUTPUTDIR FEATDIRECTORY [--all] [--hires]

		required arguments:
			INPUTFILEROOT      - The base name of the rapidtide maps up to but not including the underscore
			OUTPUTDIR          - The location for the output files
			FEADDIRECTORY      - A feat directory (x.feat) where registration to standard space has been performed

		optional arguments:
			--all              - also transform the corrout file (warning - file may be huge)
			--hires            - transform to match the high resolution anatomic image rather than the standard
			--linear           - only do linear transformation, even if warpfile exists


showxcorr

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Like rapidtide2, but for single time courses.  Takes two text files as input, calculates and displays

	the significance of the correlation.  It has a range of filtering,
	windowing, and correlation options.

Inputs:
^^^^^^^
	showxcorr requires two text files containing timecourses with the same sample rate, one timepoint per line, which are to be correlated, and the sample rate.

Outputs:
^^^^^^^^
	showxcorr outputs everything to standard out, including the Pearson correlation, the maximum cross correlation, the time of maximum cross correlation, and estimates of the significance levels (if specified).  There are no output files.

OrthoImageItem.py
-----------------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
	This is a class that implements the orthographic projection module that is used to display all of the maps in tidepool. It uses pyqtgraph to do all the heavy lifting.  None of the built-ins in pyqtgraph did exactly what I wanted in terms of allowing 3D selection, overlays and the like, so I cobbled this together.  It may be generally useful to anybody wanting to display functional data.
